        <p>
          My name is Hao Chau. I am from Saigon, Vietnam. It is
          such a honor for me to study here in Canada (aka the "Great" White North).<br />
          I am currently studying Computer Engineering at Carleton University, 
          and persuing to become a professional font-end developer.<br /> 
          I am a web application enthusiast.
          I am passionate about CSS, and having a lot of fun with it by trying different
          naming conventions, 3D-transformations, preprocessors, and helping friends out. <br />
          I am a cat person.
